Needless to say, the last several weeks have been quite busy at the
Lerch household. Kathryn is now 8lbs, 10oz, and we can tell she's grown.
We've gotten lots of [pictures](http://kathrynmarie.shutterfly.com)
(direct link new pictures
[here](http://kathrynmarie.shutterfly.com/action/pictures?a=67b0de21b33eb0dce4c1))
and several new
[videos](http://www.youtube.com/profile_videos?user=kellyemil) posted.
Very cute! Here's a quick rundown on the pictures:  

-   Kathryn likes to "bird" us (we think she looks like a baby bird
    asking for food) when hungry. We got [this
    video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJaKoDVMdpw) of it on July
    6th.
-   She started to be able to [hold her head
    up](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktv_YzfLj0Y) right around July
    13th.
-   We got lots of video of her [first real
    bath](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8FrZrOdgh8) (before July 20th
    it was all sponge baths), [the dressing
    process](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzuPrwnOgk), and afterwards
    we [posed for a family
    picture](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW5RNA6QnyI).
-   Yesterday (July 20) we got some video of her now very lengthy [wake
    up process](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSP2Y4ST0C8).
