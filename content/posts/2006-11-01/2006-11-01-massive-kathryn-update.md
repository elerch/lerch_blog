Sorry about the large amount of video and pictures, but Kathryn has just
been getting cuter and cuter! The last couple weeks have been very busy.
She had her second series of immunization shots (for the same things as
her first series) on October 25th, which she took very well. She spent
some time on that day interviewing for a day care provider and settled
on Heidi, an in home provider. Also on the 25th, she decided to hang out
in a pumpkin!  
  
She celebrated her 4 month birthday in style, and had fun on Halloween
dressing up as a bunny and going into work with Kelly. On 11/1, Kelly
restarted work on a part time basis and Kathryn met all her new friends
at day care. So far she seems to love them and they love her!  
  
So, the new photos, all 111 of them, can be found on the new [shutterfly
album](http://kathrynmarie.shutterfly.com/action/pictures?a=67b0de21b3201b10e45f).  
  
There are also a bunch of new videos added to YouTube. They are:
