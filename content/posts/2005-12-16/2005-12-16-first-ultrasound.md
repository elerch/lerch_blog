Here are some pictures from our first ultrasound! This was so exciting
because not only was it the first time we saw the baby, but it was the
first time we heard the heartbeat (155 beats per minute). This
ultrasound is pretty short, only about 10 minutes, but we got some great
pictures.

Here in the first one you can see the baby's profile. Emil and I both
love this picture!!

The baby flipped during the ultrasound. Here it is face down.

this shot you can see the baby's little hand at the bottom of the
picture. During the ultrasound we saw the baby wave hello to us. That
was one of our favorite moments.

This is a closer shot of the baby's profile. This is my favorite one!!
FYI..some baby features such as the nose develop much faster than other
parts, so everything in this picture tells us things are going well!
