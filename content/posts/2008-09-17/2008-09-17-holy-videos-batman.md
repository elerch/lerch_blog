Ok - so we've been really slow in getting videos on the web. Needless to
say, things are pretty crazy with two little ones, and Kelly is now back
at work - yikes!  
  
I got some time a little while ago, so I've posted several months worth
of videos (50+ total!). I won't bother to describe them all, but they
are up on [our youtube channel](http://www.youtube.com/lerchfamily) for
your enjoyment. The first video is "Kathryn and Megan Play" (from back
in March!), and the last video is "Kathryn shovels sand", taken on labor
day at [OMSI](http://www.omsi.edu/) when grandma Lerch visited the
family.  
  
Some other videos, taken by [Paul](http://pdockter.blogspot.com/), are
up on qik.com: <http://qik.com/belbo>  
  
Lots of pictures have been posted on [our shutterfly
site](http://thelerchs.shutterfly.com/), with more to come. There are
now some more [July pictures](http://thelerchs.shutterfly.com/8), as
well as some of the [professional
pictures](http://thelerchs.shutterfly.com/820) that were taken at the
[Rose Garden](http://www.rosegardenstore.org/thegardensoverview.cfm).  
  
Paul also has more pictures on [his picassa
site](http://picasaweb.google.com/pdockter/2007MiscKathryn?authkey=cZY_AbWyaVc#).  
  
There are more photos still in my email/hard drive waiting to be posted,
so stay tuned!
