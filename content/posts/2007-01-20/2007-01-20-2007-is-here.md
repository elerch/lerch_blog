It's been a whirlwind holiday season! The Lerch family was in Chicago to
celebrate Kathryn's first Christmas!  
  
Kathryn did great on the flights back and forth. She loved the airport
as she is facinated by all the people. She was definetly a head turner
hanging out in her Bjorn carrier wearing her little Santa cap. She gave
and received lots of smiles. As this was Kathryn's second plane flight
she felt she was a pro and wanted to hand over her own boarding pass to
the gate agent. Needless to say this was unbelieveably cute.  
  
Kathryn loved opening her presents, and as expected was generally more
facinated by the paper than the gift. She definetly made out like a
bandit in the gift department this year! Check her out in her 'First
Christmas' hat from Aunt Karyn and Uncle Nick.  
  
Developmentally there have been lots of changes! Probably most exciting
is that Kathryn has mastered sitting up! She can reach and grab toys
around her and is definetly into playing with anything within her grasp.
As she also likes faces you are likely to get your nose and lips grabbed
when you list expect it. Kathryn has also discovered she can play ball
with Mom and Dad, which resulted in lots of giggles! She grabs her feet
on the changing table and will sometimes put them in her mouth. Kathryn
has also discovered her voice, resulting in lots of loud 'aaaahhhhhh'
and squeals.  
  
Some of the most fun, and definetly messy, times we've had have been
feeding Kathryn food. After rice cereal, and then peas (not her
favorite), we've had all sorts of stuff including oatmeal, peaches,
bananas (loves them!), apples, apricots, squash, and sweet potatoes. She
always takes the first bit and then scrunches up her face like she
doesn't like it, yet always wants more!  
  
On January 8th Kathryn had her 6-month doctor's appointment. She is
26.75 inches long, 15 pounds 1 ounce, head circumfrance 17 inches. This
puts her roughly in the 25% for weight and 75% for height.  
  
The latest pictures are Kathryn in the snow in Portland. She even got
daycare cancelled for two days, so she got to hang at home with Mom and
Dad! Here's all the pictures and videos posted since the last update.
