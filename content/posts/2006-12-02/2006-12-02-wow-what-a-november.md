The last month has just flown by! Mostly becuase it has been so fun!
Emil and I have loved this age. I've been back at work 3 days a week and
Kathryn has been going to daycare. She still seems to love the other
older children!  
  
This month Kathryn got to see her
[Grandma](http://youtube.com/watch?v=1wWh3LhyBno) and Grandpa Sloan and
Grammy and Great Grammy Lerch! In addition, she met her uncles and
cousin on the Gehman side over Thanksgiving. Very fun!  
  
As far as Milestones, this month Kathryn learned how to [roll over from
back to stomach](http://youtube.com/watch?v=MakdxoIaWZ0). She does this
[several times a day now](http://youtube.com/watch?v=S-m0SuLNdR8),
generally preferring her stomach to her back. Just today she did it
during her nap! We also started her on [rice
cereal](http://youtube.com/watch?v=NlDaFCx2jek). She has taken to it
really well and is now \*very\* interested in food in general. While we
don't know exactly how much she weighs our estimates put her about 15
pounds and 25 inches long!  
  
Probably the most thing is that Kathryn really laughes now. She is
getting more and more into peekaboo, and will definetly giggle if you
give her tummy a gentle buzzing.
