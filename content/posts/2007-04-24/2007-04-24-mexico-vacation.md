The family had a great time in Mexico celebrating Kelly's mom's
retirement! We spent the week in [Casa
Manana](http://www.beachfrontmexico.com/) in
[Bucerias](http://www.buceriasmexico.com/), about 30 minutes north of
[Puerto Vallarta](http://www.puertovallarta.net/). Emil, Kathryn,
Kelly's parents, sister, and brother-in-law were all there.

Tuesday, Mike, Emil, and Nick went fishing, and Emil and Nick caught
some huge
[Roosterfish](http://www.anglingdirectholidays.com/pages/rooster_fish.html).
Emil's broke the Mexican Roosterfish record and was 63" long and 96lbs,
while Nick's was 54" long and 83lbs. The world record was 66" long and
114lbs. They are some big (and very heavy) fish!
