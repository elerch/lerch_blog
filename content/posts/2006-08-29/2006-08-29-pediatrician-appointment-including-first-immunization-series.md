(if you want to skip all the crazy pediatrician update, yes, there are
[more Kathryn pictures on
Shutterfly!](http://kathrynmarie.shutterfly.com/action/pictures?a=67b0de21b33c9078a4ed))  
  
It's been a pretty busy time the last few weeks. The family has been
working on a sleep schedule, preparing for [Kelly's sister's
wedding](http://www.nickandkaryn.com/), and traveling to
[Chicago](http://www.cityofchicago.org).  
  
Now that the excuses are out of the way, Kathryn had her second regular
pediatrician appointment, which included several shots of the standard
[CDC recommended immunization
series](http://www.cdc.gov/nip/recs/child-schedule-color-print.pdf).
Looking at the PDF file, she got the "2 month" series, which included:  

-   Hep B: Heppatitus B
-   PCV: Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine
-   Hib: Haemophilus Influenza Type b
-   DTaP: Diptheria, Tetanus and Pertussis
-   IPV: Inactivated Polio Virus

Wow...That was hard to type. Anyway, it basically 3 actual shots (two in
the left leg, one in the right), and an oral vaccine. The oral was a
fairly new vaccine that saved her from a 4th shot. Needless to say,
Kathryn didn't like that one bit. It was somewhat of a delayed reaction,
as she had never had a shot before, and she stayed pretty grumpy for the
next 24 hours. Apparently that's actually pretty good, as some babies
are grumpy for 3 days, but it still didn't make the parents very happy.

The fun pediatrician update:

-   Weight: 10lbs, 7.8oz (60%)
-   Height: 23 in (75%)
-   Head: 39 cm (75%)

The head went from the 25th to the 75th percentile in 6 weeks, so we
were pretty amazed.

Kathryn now smiles in the morning pretty consistently and can control
her head better each day. She's also rolling over a lot more and even
decided to show the pediatrician her new trick! We've seen lots of
"mini-pushups", and we think she's starting to grab for (and kick at)
things. She definitely knows her parents faces and voices now. The
cutest thing is Kathryn's cooing noises. She loves to say 'gahh' and
'agoo'.

As far as sleep goes, she's not yet sleeping through the night or
anything, but will do 5 or 6 hours at a time (usually from about 9PM to
2 or 3 AM). After the 2 or 3AM feeding, she will go back to sleep until
5AM or so, when she'll demand to be held until 8 or 9AM. Naps in her
crib or pack 'n play are a challenge, but we are working on it!
