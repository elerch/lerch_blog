It's been a long time since our last post, and we have some exciting
news to share! We are expecting our second baby! The approximate due
date is December 17th, which puts me at about 20 weeks right now. In
fact Emil and I have our ultrasound this upcoming Friday, but are still
on fence as to if we find out the gender or not. (Ok, \*I'm\* on the
fence, Emil definitely wants to know.) As you may recall we did not find
out with Kathryn.  
  
Based on the due date our newest little one and Kathryn will be almost
exactly 18 months apart. Several folks have asked if we had planned
this, and the answer is not exactly. We always wanted the kids close
together, but 18 months was a bit sooner than we had expected. Yikes!
This is Kathryn when we told her the news....

We found out we were pregnant on Tuesday April 10th, after watching a
TIVO'ed episode of '24'. I just had this strong feeling I was pregnant -
and sure enough! Needless to say Emil and I were both more than a little
surprised!  
  
So far the pregnancy has gone fairly well, but I was much more nauseous
with this one than Kathryn. It was worst from 4:00 - 8:00 PM. This made
taking care of Kathryn at night a bit tough. Even the thought of baby
food made my stomach turn (still does actually). And changing poopy
diapers...forget it! Poor Emil had to do much of the child care himself
for about 14 weeks. But now that I'm about half-way there I'm doing
great!  
  
I really started to feel the baby move last week, around 18 weeks along.
It's very cool. At first this one was only active at night, but now I
feel it in the afternoon and when I go to bed around 10 PM. At times I'm
a bit sad, knowing this is likely the last time I'll be pregnant. Emil
and I are very excited, but our big concern right now is where to put
the new baby! Kathryn won't quite be old enough for a 'big girl' bed,
and I'm not sure I want to do two nurseries.... hmmm..  
  
Here are a few pictures from our first ultrasound!
