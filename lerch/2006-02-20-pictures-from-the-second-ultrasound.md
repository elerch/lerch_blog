Here are the scanned ultrasound pictures from our second ultrasound.
Everything measures great, and according to the measurements are due
date is 7/2/2006 +/- 1 week. That’s pretty much the same as our original
due date of 6/30.

this first picture the baby is making a fist. You can see the four
fingers directly in the middle of the picture (think of what a fist
looks like if someone were going to punch you (hmm…maybe the baby’s mad
:-) ). The face is on the bottom right and a bit of the rib cage on the
bottom left.

this picture you might be able to see the bottom of the foot. If you
can, please let us know, because we pretty much can’t see anything. The
tech was trying to get a picture just when the baby pressed its foot
against the ultrasound device. We did see some very cool pictures of the
feet, but the baby kept pushing out and retracting its foot, and the
tech just missed it.

third picture is one of the coolest pictures, if you can see it. Most
ultrasound pictures you expect to see a profile. This is not. The baby
is looking <span style="font-weight: bold;">\*directly at the
camera\*</span> and you can see the eyes, nose, mouth, and ribcage (to
the left). Most people we’ve shown this picture to cannot see the face
until they turn the picture 90 degrees counter clockwise and then it
comes into view. After a week of looking at the pictures, it has
probably become my favorite.

picture is Kelly’s favorite, and used to be mine. It’s the standard
profile picture, with rib cage on the left, the face (almost) in profile
view right in the center. You can also see something above the rib cage.
This might be part of the arm or the hands, but we’re not sure.

picture is highly similar to the one above, so I'll let you enjoy it.

last one is a further-out view of the baby. I’m assuming that’s the head
on the bottom right, but it could also be parts of an apple Kelly had
that day. ;-)
