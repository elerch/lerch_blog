Just a quick note to mention that there are more pictures of Kathryn up
on shutterfly, and there is another
[video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qkwn6Y-PbjE) taken this morning.
The video is just a little light-challenged, but clearly shows Kathryn
rolling over. Use the link above or just view it below.  

More pictures are also available on Shutterfly, including the one that
came in the announcements. We've basically just done a couple new albums
with rough timeframes.  

-   The [last week of
    July](http://kathrynmarie.shutterfly.com/action/pictures?a=67b0de21b33f54874594)
    album shows various pictures, including the one from the
    announcement (and another that was a very close second)
-   The [5th week of life
    album](http://kathrynmarie.shutterfly.com/action/pictures?a=67b0de21b33fd603c461)
    shows pictures, coincidentally, of her 5th week of life. She's
    definitely getting more animated. Still waiting to have the camera
    handy for really good smile...she's doing that more and more.
