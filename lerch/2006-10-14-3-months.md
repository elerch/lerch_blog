Kathryn is now 3 months old! It has gone by so fast. All of her 0-3
clothes are now put away.  
:-( But we are now in tons of new 3-6 month outfits! Including her
super-cute apple outfit. Check out her [latest
pics](http://kathrynmarie.shutterfly.com/action/pictures?a=67b0de21b32293a4a437).  
  
In the last month Kathryn did get a cold, even in her eyes (very goopy),
and that was no fun. I was sick at the same time with a fever. Emil had
his hands full taking care of his girls. The Lerch household was
definetly under the weather for about a week, explaining the lack of
photos and blogging.  
  
Kathryn now bats at objects, and even grabs some of her rattles and
toys. She is smiling and cooing even more now. She has laughed, but just
a handful of times. Very cute!  
  
On the social scene Kathryn has been going to weekly playgroups and
mom's group. She now notices the other babies and had a conversation
with her friend Lucia.
