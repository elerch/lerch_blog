Grammy Lerch came for [her first visit with
Kathryn](http://kathrynmarie.shutterfly.com/action/pictures?a=67b0de21b3233e70c461)
last week! They had a great time playing together with Kathryn's toys
including the pink puppy and the little monkey. Grammy also read Kathryn
'Fox in Sox', which she very much enjoyed.  
  
Unfortunately while Grammy was here Kathryn started to have odd night
wakings where she required additional burping and was spitting up. Back
to the pediatrician we went, where she was diagnosed with acid reflux.
Kathryn is now taking Zantac, and so far things have been great!  
  
Our best outing with Grammy was to the pumpkin patch! Kathryn pet her
first horse, and saw a donkey! Not to mention all the pumpkins. We got
lucky with a beautiful (albeit windy) day. There are some great pictures
- so please do check them out!
