Two videos have now been published. It's been a while since we had some
downtime to do video transfer/conversion/upload from the video we shot
in the hospital, but now it's been done. You can now view Kathryn's
[first bath](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtwxDkJGqyE) and the way
that her [first professional
pictures](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUBzhguwadM) were taken. What
you can't see in the second video is that the camera used is operated by
foot pedals, so the operator has their hands free to distract the
subject.  
  
The professional pictures should be sent to us shortly, but there is a
[web
nursery](http://www.growingfamily.com/webnursery/hospitals/template/hospitalpage.asp?mode=search&birthMonth=6&birthYear=2006&birthDate=28&HospitalID=7445)
where you should be able to see the final cut. She's not posted yet, but
should be there later this week.
