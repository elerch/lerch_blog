is now standing on her own, and on August 13th, she decided to start
walking on her own. She usually does just a few steps on her own right
now, but any day she'll be running around like crazy. With any luck,
she'll be running through the [fountain near our
house](http://maps.live.com/default.aspx?v=2&cp=rks3nv4rx8p6&style=o&lvl=2&amp;amp;tilt=-90&dir=0&alt=-1000&scene=5564566&sp=Point.rktk3c4rxjk6_6068%20NW%20Calypso%20Ter%2C%20Portland%2C%20OR%2097229-1554%2C%20United%20States___%7EPoint.rks4qp4rx8kq_Fountain%20near%20our%20house___&encType=1)
