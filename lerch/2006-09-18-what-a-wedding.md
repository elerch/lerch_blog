<span class="underline">Lyrics to 'Love Love Baby':</span>  
  
They were in Jamaica for swimming and for fun  
Karyn with her fam, and Amanda in the sun  
Something grabbed her and Nick tightly  
And they became an item on the bar scene nightly  
Will it ever stop Yo - don't think so!  
Now they're in Chicago and that I know  
To the extreme their love they can handle  
They light up the stage and today they lit the candle!  
  
Nick moved to Chicago even though its cold  
he promised to love Karyn until they're old  
They work together doing the graphics thing  
Last July Nick proposed downtown at the bean.  
  
Love it or leave it Nick had to like flags  
He built a wagon to carry the bags  
If there was a problem - Yo Nick will solve it!  
Check out his hair after the girls mohawked it!  
  
Love Love Baby, Forever Love Love Baby
